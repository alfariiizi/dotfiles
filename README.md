# Alfarizi's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection of configuration files is managed using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), a robust tool designed to help users manage their dotfiles across multiple machines efficiently and securely.

## About Chezmoi

[Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) makes it super easy to handle your configuration files across various environments. It allows for both privacy (with encryption options) and flexibility (with templates for different machines), ensuring that your settings are precisely how you want them, wherever you are.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains all the essential dotfiles that I use for my daily workflows. This includes configurations for shells, editors, and any other tools that help me be productive.

## Getting Started

To use these dotfiles, you'll need to install Chezmoi first. You can install it on a variety of platforms using the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)" -- init --apply alfarizi
```

This command sets up everything by cloning the [alfariiizi/dotfiles](https://github.com/alfariiizi/dotfiles) repo and applying the dotfiles to your local machine.
